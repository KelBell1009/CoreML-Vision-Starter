# CoreML-Vision-Starter
Starter project for intro to iOS at Capital One Software Summit. If you would like to follow along please clone this project. 

**NOTE:** This project is a bit large because it contains two models (.mlmodel). 

We will be using Core ML and Vision which are two new frameworks in iOS 11. The goal is to learn the basics of Xcode and iOS while building a simple Machine Learning application.
